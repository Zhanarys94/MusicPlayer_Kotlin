# MusicPlayer_Kotlin
Study project for Hyperskill Android Studio with Kotlin path.

Build a music player with a single activity: a list of songs, the playback control, and the ability to create playlists and play music from files.
Everyone with a computer has searched for a good music player at least once. Most of them either work on a paid subscription, contain advertising, or don't have the necessary functions. In this project, you will create your player.
